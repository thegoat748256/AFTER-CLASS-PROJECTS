    <h2>Heres all the buzz about honeybees:</h2>
    <h3>Honey bees are social insects known for producing honey and pollinating plants. They live in colonies with a queen bee,
    worker bees, and drones. Worker bees collect nectar and pollen, which they convert into honey and store in honeycomb
    cells. Honey bees are vital pollinators, facilitating the reproduction of many plants, including those that produce our
    food. Their "waggle dance" is a unique communication method for sharing food source locations.</h3>
    <h2>Fun facts about honeybees</h2>
    <h3>1 Not all bees sting: Only female bees can sting, and when they do, it's usually a defensive action. Male bees (drones)
    don't have stingers.</h3>
    <h3>2 Honey bees can fly up to 15 miles per hour.</h3>
    <h3>3 They have five eyes. Three are simple eyes on top of their head and two are compound eyes.</h3>
    <h3>4 Bees beat their wings very fast: They flap their wings about 200 times per second, which creates the buzzing sound we
    hear.</h3>
    <h3>5 Honey bees communicate through dancing. They perform a "waggle dance" to share information about food sources.</h3>
    <h3>6 They have a powerful sense of smell: Honey bees have 170 odorant receptors, making their sense of smell 50 times more
    powerful than a dog's.</h3>
    <h3>7 Honey bees are essential pollinators: They are vital for the pollination of many fruits, vegetables, and other plants.</h3>
    <h3>8 They can recognize human faces: This is a relatively recent discovery that shows their intelligence and cognitive
    abilities.</h3>
    <h3>9 Bees can see ultraviolet light: This helps them find flowers, as some flowers have patterns visible only in ultraviolet
    light.</h3>
    <h3>10 Bees can't see the color red: However, they can still be attracted to red flowers due to the ultraviolet patterns.</h3>
    <h3>11 A single worker bee makes only about 1/12 of a teaspoon of honey in her lifetime.</h3>
    <h3>12 Honey bees have two stomachs: One is for eating, and the other is for storing nectar and processing it into honey.</h3>
    <h3>13 A honeybee colony can contain up to 60,000 bees.</h3>
