    <h2>The Solar System consists of the Sun, eight planets, their moons, asteroids, and comets, all bound by the Sun's gravity.</h2>
    <p> It's center is the Sun, a star that provides light and heat. Orbiting the Sun are the inner rocky planets (Mercury,
    Venus, Earth, Mars) and the outer gas and ice giants (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune). Moons orbit the planets, while
    asteroids and comets are smaller bodies found throughout the system. The Solar System is a vast, mostly empty space that
    formed about 4.6 billion years ago, a cosmic neighborhood within the Milky Way galaxy.</p>
